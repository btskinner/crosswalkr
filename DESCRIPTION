Description: A pair of functions for renaming and encoding data frames
	     using external crosswalk files. Especially useful when
	     constructing master data sets from multiple smaller data
	     sets that do not name or encode variables consistently
	     across files. Based on -renamefrom- and -encodefrom-
	     Stata commands written by Sally Hudson et al.
